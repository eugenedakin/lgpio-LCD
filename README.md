# lgpio-LCD
Code to display text on an LCD with lgpio library

This is a lgpio library that is a replacement for the deprecated wiringPi library that
is to be used with Xojo apps. A book has been written called 'I Wish I Knew How To...
Program Raspberry Pi 4B Electronics with Xojo: lgpio Edition' is being written and the 
examples use this library exclusively. More instructions about the book will be available
at https://www.scispec.ca and press the button on books. 

This library is to be used with the lgpio-GPIO library. Examples are in Chapter 12 of the book.

The estimated time for the book to be released is the fall of 2023.
