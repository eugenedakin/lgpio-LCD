This is a lgpio library that is a replacement for the deprecated wiringPi library that
is to be used with Xojo apps. A book has been written called 'I Wish I Knew How To...
Program Raspberry Pi 4B Electronics with Xojo: lgpio Edition' is being written and the 
examples use this library exclusively. More instructions about the book will be available
